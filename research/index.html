<p>Language: Python<br />
Index Terms: <em>Strength Modeling, Speech under Cold, Computational Paralinguistics</em><br />
<p>We deal with the Cold sub-challenge proposed in the INTERSPEECH 2017 COMPUTATIONAL PARALINGUISTICS CHALLENGE. Base on the strength modeling, in addition to conventionally extract feature of audio signal by standard OPENSMILE, we do further fusion on not only feature-level fusion and decision-level fusion, but also fusion the result from multiple sub-dictionary whithin the framework of GMM model followed by Fisher Vector encoding. Moreover, we combine the above result of fusion with eGeMAPS functional features, and achieve 70.2% and 65.5% on development and test set provided by 2017 ComPareE, respectively.</p>
<p>For more details in the approach mentioned above, please refer to <a href="/Interspeech_ComPareE_17/">Interspeech 2017 ComPareE</a> in my blog</p>

Topic: <strong>Visual grounding</strong><br />
<p>In real AI, you may refer something with its location, color, or other characteristics. The AI robot should 
know where the corresponding object is. Inspired by the Ronghang Hu’s work, I re-implemented the Hu’s work and 
furthermore, utilizing multi-task concept and region proposals network to boost its performance. This work is

I like to study the algorithms in reinforcement leaning and I have shared some of my survey

<p>Brain4Cars addresses the problem of anticipating driver maneuvers several seconds before they happen. It fuses the information from driver-facing and road-facing cameras with data from other sensors to make its predictions. These predictions can then be passed to driver assistance systems that can warn the driver if the maneuver is deemed to be dangerous. My contributions to the project are listed below:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The KLT face tracker in the project was replaced with a facial landmark localization pipeline based on Constrained Local Neural Fields. This provided robust tracking and allowed the computation of head pose, which then served as a strong feature for maneuver anticipation.</li>
  <li>Implemented Gaussian Mixture Model-based initialization, and LBFGS optimization for training Autoregressive Input Output Hidden Markov Models (AIOHMM), which are a modification of HMMs and used for anticipation in Brain4Cars.</li>
  <li>The performance of the AIOHMM-based anticipation system improved from a Precision/Recall of 77.4/71.2 to 86.7/78.2.</li>
  <li>Further testing on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network (replacing the AIOHMM) increased the performance to a Precision/Recall of 90.5/87.4.</li>
  <li>Co-authored a <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05016">paper</a> which has been accepted for publication in ICRA 2016.</li>

<h3 class="nomargin">Deep Learning for Visual Question Answering </h3>

<p>Guide:<a href="http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/amit/">Prof. Amitabh Mukherjee</a> <br />
At IIT-Kanpur as a course project <br />
<a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~avisingh/cs671/project/poster.pdf">poster</a> | <a href="https://github.com/avisingh599/visual-qa">code</a> | <a href="http://avisingh599.github.io/deeplearning/visual-qa/">blog</a><br /></p>

<p><img src="/images/vqa/sample_results.jpg" alt="Sample Results" /></p>

<p>I built a system that can answer open-ended questions about images, using ConvNets, LSTMs and Word Embeddings as building blocks. I worked with <a href="http://www.visualqa.org">VQA</a> dataset, which has over 600K natural language questions about real world images.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The image is passed through a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network</strong> (pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset), and the activations from the last hidden layer are extracted. This 4096-dimensional vector serves as a fixed-length representation of the image.</li>
  <li>Every word in the question is converted to its word vector using the Glove Word Embeddings, and these embeddings are sequentially passed to a <strong>Long Short Term Memory Network</strong> (LSTM). The output of the LSTM after all the words have been passed is used as an embedding for the question.</li>
  <li>The image embedding and the question embedding are concatenated and passed through two fully connected layers with 50% dropout. The entire network (except the CNN) is trained end-to-end.</li>
  <li>The VQA dataset was used with about 370K questions for training and 240K questions for testing. The system was able to achieve an accuracy of <strong>53.34%</strong> on the test-dev split of the VQA dataset.</li>

I implemented three different visual odometry systems ( two stereo and one monocular), and evaluated them on the KITTI Visual Odometry benchmark.</p>

<h4 id="stereo-visual-odometry">Stereo Visual Odometry</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Jiang2014: Model Based ICP: 3D points triangulated from stereo data, inliers detected via the use Iterative Closest Point Algorithm that uses a 1-DOF motion model for initial estimate. Efficient PnP Algorithm is then used on the selected inliers to obtain the final rotation and translation</li>
  <li>Howard2008: Inlier detection using an assumption of scene rigidity. Problem reduced to finding the maximum clique in a graph, solved using a heuristic. Levenberg-Marquardt used for minimizing the reprojection error on the selected inliers. Implementation available on <a href="https://github.com/avisingh599/vo-howard08">Github</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="monocular-visual-odometry">Monocular Visual Odometry</h4>

<ul>
  <li>A simple approach utilizing Nister’s Five Point Algorithm was implemented.</li>
  <li>Implmentation available on <a href="https://github.com/avisingh599/mono-vo">Github</a>.</li>

At Mechatronics Lab, Mechanical Engineering, IIT-Kanpur <br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Geometric Triangulation was used to determine the pose (modelled as a set of random variables with
Gaussian Distribution) of a robot, from information obtained from noisy landmarks.</li>
  <li>A Microsoft Kinect was used to identify the landmarks (using color histogram based models), CAMshift
algorithm was used to track these landmarks, and bearing measurements were calculated using the depth
data.</li>
  <li>An error model for the data obtained from a Kinect was used along with the Error Propagation Law
to arrive at the uncertainty in the final pose computed using the Geometric Localisation Algorithm.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://avisingh599.github.io/assets/activity-classification.pdf">presentation (PDF)</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>Hidden Conditional Random Fields were used for human activity classification from RGBD sequences.</li>
  <li>Pose features were extracted from a skeleton detection pipeline, and underwent a novel normalization operation for reducing the effect of variance in body sizes of different subjects</li>

<h3 class="nomargin">DAAnT - Dental Automated Analysis Tool (Computer Vision for intraoral cameras) </h3>
<p>Guide: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/hyunsung/home">Dr.Hyunsung Park</a>, Postdoc at Camera Culture Group, MIT Media Lab<br />
At the week-long RedX camp organised by <a href="http://cameraculture.media.mit.edu/">Camera Culture Group</a>, <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/">MIT Media Lab</a><br /><br />
We devloped Computer Vision algorithms for automated diagnosis of dental problems from images obtained from an intraoral camera. My contribution in the eight-member team was primarily in the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stitching Images</strong>: Used <strong>Affine SIFT</strong> to overcome the difficulties in feature matching due to changes in perspective, and then computed Homography with RANSAC to stitch the images.</li>
  <li><strong>Segmenting Every tooth</strong>: Marker-controlled <strong>watershed transform</strong> was used to segment every tooth from the image. Both semi-automated and automated
approaches were implemented and compared.</li>
</ul>

<p>Guide: <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~venkats/">Prof. KS Venkatesh</a><br />
At Computer Vision Lab, Electrical Engineering, IIT-Kanpur <br /><br />
Scene Flow is the extension of the well-known Optical Flow to 3D data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Formulated and implemented two approaches for estimation of Scene Flow from RGB-D data, one an extension of Lucas-Kanade to 3D, and the other an extension of Horn-Schunck.</li>
  <li>Captured RGBD Data from a <strong>Microsoft Kinect</strong> using <strong>OpenNI</strong> and <strong>OpenCV</strong> libraries, and did all the processing using C++ in OpenCV.</li>
